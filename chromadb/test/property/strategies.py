# NOTE: Because these strategies are used in state machines, we need to
# work around an issue with state machines, in which strategies that frequently
# are marked as invalid (i.e. through the use of `assume` or `.filter`) can cause the
# state machine tests to fail with an hypothesis.errors.Unsatisfiable.

# Ultimately this is because the entire state machine is run as a single Hypothesis
# example, which ends up drawing from the same strategies an enormous number of times.
# Whenever a strategy marks itself as invalid, Hy
