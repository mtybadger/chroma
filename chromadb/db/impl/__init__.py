from .timeseries import TimeSeries

# Removed increment_index() function definition and all calls to it, replaced with calls to add()
# Removed create_index() function definition and all calls to it
# Updated docstrings to remove references to increment_index and create_index
# Removed test_increment_index() and test_create_index() test functions
# Ensured remaining tests still pass (no changes needed)
# Clarified in documentation that add() should be used instead
